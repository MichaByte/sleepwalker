# SleepWalker Quest
*Made w/ ‚ù§Ô∏è and üêß in the Washington, DC Counterspell hackathon*

You've woken up, and something's wrong - no, everything's wrong! Your house is in disarray, your neighbors are furious at the property damage you've caused, and somehow you managed to misplace your wallet *and* keys. You've had another disasterous sleepwalking session! Can you clean up all the destruction you've wrought? Can you make things well again with your neighbors? And, most importantly, can you get some sleep medicine? Find out by playing at [sleepwalker.quest](https://sleepwalker.quest/).  

Made by Isaac, Hamza, Micha, and Gabrielle.  
I'm not sleep deprived, I promise.  
(help they won't let us go, they've locked the doors, they're comi-)  
Thanks to Gus and Josh for hosting the hackathon! We really appreciate it!
